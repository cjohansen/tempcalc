# tempcalc

A tiny webapp that calculates the required temperatures of various substances to
reach a given target temperature of the full mix.

Example use case is bread dough: You need a dough at 26C. Your salt and flour
are 24C, your yeast is 4C. Given 1000 grams of flour, 20 grams of salt, 4 grams
of yeast and 750 grams of water, what temperature should the water be? This app
tells you.
